This downloads all the necessary components for the container.**

```terminal
docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 nginx
```
**Nginx installed, you can configure the container so that itâ€™s publicly accessible as a web server.**

**run is the command to create a new container**

**The --name flag is how you specify the name of the container. If left blank, a generated name like nostalgic_hopper will be assigned.**

**-p specifies the port you are exposing in the format of -p local-machine-port:internal-container-port. In this case, you are mapping port :80 in the container to port :80 on the server.**

**nginx is the name of the image on Docker Hub.**

```terminal
docker rm docker-nginx
```
**Remove the existing  container**

```terminal

```terminal
docker stop docker-nginx
```
**Stop the container**


```terminal
