COMPUTER - Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research
AND is defined as 'A computer is an electronic device that takes in raw data from the user and processes it. It can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of logical or arithmetic operations'

1. COMPUTER is  mainly divided into three parts- A. Computation B.Storage C. Network

A. COMPUTATION:-

A.1 CPU - Central processing unit is the primary component of a computer that acts as its â€œcontrol center.

A.2 DPU - A data processing unit is  a specialized processor that helps the central processing unit (CPU) with tasks like networking, security, and storage.
    DPUs are sometimes called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs". Leading providers of DPUs include NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD.
    
A.3 APU - Accelerated Processing Unit is a processor that combines a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) into one chip.

A.4 NPU - A neural processing unit is a specialized processor that accelerates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

A.5 TPU - Tensor Processing Unit is a custom-made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google to speed up machine learning workloads. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.

A.6 FPGA - A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be reconfigured after manufacturing to suit specific needs. FPGAs are often used in applications that require high data processing or transactions, such as financial trading, molecular dynamics, and bioscience.

A.7 ASIC - Application-Specific integrated circuit is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

A.8 CISC - A Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processor is a type of computer architecture that uses a large set of instructions to perform complex tasks.(X-86 ARCHITECTURE)

A.9 RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a microprocessor that uses a small set of simple instructions to perform tasks.(ARM ARCHITECTURE)
![risc-vs-cisc](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63dd70b9-e7af-411c-9961-4dfacf54536d)
 A.10 RISC-V  - RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that's used to design custom processors for a variety of applications. It's based on the principles of reduced instruction set computers (RISC) and is pronounced "risk-five".

 A.11 SOC - A system on a chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that contains most or all of a computer or other electronic system's components on a single chip.

B. MEMORY AND STORAGE -  the electronic components that store data and instructions for a computer to access quickly. It is used to store information that the computer's processor needs to run applications and open files.Memory is what your computer uses to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently.
                                                        TYPES OF IT -
   B.1 PRIMARY - Also known as main memory, this is the computer's main memory that stores data, programs, and instructions that are currently in use.Like RAM
   B.2 SECONDARY - This type of memory provides permanent storage for data that doesn't erase when the computer is turned off. It's often used for backing up data, disaster recovery, and storing critical data for long periods of time.Like HARDDISK

C. NETWORK - A computer network is a group of devices that exchange data and resources with each other. Networks can be connected using cables or wireless media.
C.1 INTERNET -  a communications system that connects computers and computer networks all over the world.
C.2 DNS - Domain Name System (DNS): A network of computers that converts web addresses into IP addresses.
C.2 IP - An Internet Protocol (IP) address is the unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet.
   TYPES-
   1. PRIVATE - LAN(INTRANET)
    PRIVATE HAS 3 TYPES - (1) 10.x.y.z
   (2) 172.x.y.z
   (3) 192.168.x.y
   2. PUBLIC - WAN(INTERNET)
C.3 MAC - A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier for a device's network interface controller (NIC) that's used in network communications. It's also known as a hardware address, physical address, or burned-in address (BIA).
C.4 PORT - Port addresses, or port numbers, are 16-bit unsigned integers that are appended to an IP address to direct internet traffic to a specific process or service.

2. OSI - The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

3. BLOCKCHAIN - Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed database technology that stores data in blocks linked together in a chain. It's used to record transactions and track assets in a business network.Like Bitcoin.
   its key features - Transparency , Immutability(can't be deleted or modified without consensus from the network) , Security , Decentralization

4. OS - OPERATING SYSTEM is an Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware

these are the famous or commonly used - windows , macos , linux

5. KERNEL - The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it.

6. BARE METAL - Bare metal refers to a computer system or servers that runs without a layer of abstraction such as a virtulization layer or operating system. in this context, "bare metal" means the hardware is directly utilized for a single application or workload, allowing for maximum performance and control.

7. CLOUD COMPUTING - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources over the internet, or "the cloud", on-demand and without requiring direct management by the user.
    TYPES- a. PRIVATE - like openstack  b.PUBLIC - it has 3 which are - AWS(AMAZON WEB SERVICE) , GCP(GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM) , AZURE(MICROSOFT)

8. VM - A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that acts like a physical computer, but uses virtual resources instead of physical components. VMs can perform many of the same functions as a physical computer, such as running programs and operating systems, storing data, and connecting to networks.
