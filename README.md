A.1 CPU - Central processing unit is the primary component of a computer that acts as its â€œcontrol center.

A.2 DPU - A data processing unit is  a specialized processor that helps the central processing unit (CPU) with tasks like networking, security, and storage.
    DPUs are sometimes called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs". Leading providers of DPUs include NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD.

A.3 GPU - A graphics processing unit (GPU) is an electronic circuit that can perform mathematical calculations at high speed. Computing tasks like graphics rendering, machine learning (ML), and video editing require the application of similar mathematical operations on a large dataset.
       
A.4 APU - Accelerated Processing Unit is a processor that combines a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) into one chip.

A.5 NPU - A neural processing unit is a specialized processor that accelerates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

A.6 TPU - Tensor Processing Unit is a custom-made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google to speed up machine learning workloads. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.

A.7 FPGA - A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be reconfigured after manufacturing to suit specific needs. FPGAs are often used in applications that require high data processing or transactions, such as financial trading, molecular dynamics, and bioscience.

 A.12 SOC - A system on a chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit that contains most or all of a computer or other electronic system's components on a single chip.

B. MEMORY AND STORAGE -  the electronic components that store data and instructions for a computer to access quickly. It is used to store information that the computer's processor needs to run applications and open files.Memory is what your computer uses to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently.

TYPES-

B.1 PRIMARY - Also known as main memory, this is the computer's main memory that stores data, programs, and instructions that are currently in use.Like RAM

B.2 SECONDARY - This type of memory provides permanent storage for data that doesn't erase when the computer is turned off. It's often used for backing up data, disaster recovery, and storing critical data for long periods of time.Like HARDDISK

   3. PUBLIC - WAN(INTERNET)
      
C.4 MAC - A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier for a device's network interface controller (NIC) that's used in network communications. It's also known as a hardware address, physical address, or burned-in address (BIA).
C.5 PORT - Port addresses, or port numbers, are 16-bit unsigned integers that are appended to an IP address to direct internet traffic to a specific process or service.

2. OSI - The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.

5. KERNEL - The kernel is a core component of an operating system and serves as the main interface between the computer's physical hardware and the processes running on it.

6. BARE METAL - Bare metal refers to a computer system or servers that runs without a layer of abstraction such as a virtulization layer or operating system. in this context, "bare metal" means the hardware is directly utilized for a single application or workload, allowing for maximum performance and control.

7. CLOUD COMPUTING - Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources over the internet, or "the cloud", on-demand and without requiring direct management by the user.
    TYPES- a. PRIVATE - like openstack  b.PUBLIC - it has 3 which are - AWS(AMAZON WEB SERVICE) , GCP(GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM) , AZURE(MICROSOFT)

8. VM - A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based computer that acts like a physical computer, but uses virtual resources instead of physical components. VMs can perform many of the same functions as a physical computer, such as running programs and operating systems, storing data, and connecting to networks.

10. IPv6 - Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP) and is the successor to IPv4. IPv6 is important because it's intended to address the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion and to support the growing demand for internet connectivity.

11. KUBERNETES - Kubernetes is open-source software that helps deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications and also called k8s.

12. API - Application Programming Interface allow developers to sync data between multiple platforms and can facilitate communication among the various microservices in web applications.OR An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge between the front end and back end of an application. While backend developers usually create APIs, front end developers need to know how to use them.

13. FRONTEND - HTML , CSS , JAVASCRIPT

14. BACKEND - FRAMEWORK LIKE PYTHON(django)

and IPV6 IS 2^128

IP ADDRESS IS OF 32 bits OR 4 bytes - LIKE 192.168.X.Y each no. takes 8 bits like in this case it has 4 numbers written in form of a.b.x.y and this 8bit(one no.) called OCTET.


17. DEVOPS - DevOps is a software development practice that combines the words "development" and "operations" to describe the process of integrating these two disciplines into a single, continuous process. DevOps can help organizations deliver applications and services faster by: 
 

Breaking down silos - 
DevOps unifies people, processes, and technology across traditionally siloed roles like development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security. 
 
Enabling collaboration - 
DevOps allows for coordination and collaboration between teams that have different priorities, tasks, and timelines. 
 
Accelerating delivery - 
DevOps can speed up the delivery of code to production by incorporating automated, prescheduled code tests as the application code is being written or updated. 

Improving products - 
DevOps can help organizations evolve and improve products at a faster pace.

18. HYPERVISOR - A hypervisor is a software that you can use to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
       It has 2 types -
    * type-1 (Bare metal)- A type 1 hypervisor acts like a lightweight operating system and runs directly on the host's hardware.ex- VMware
   
    * type-2(hosted) -  a type 2 hypervisor runs as a software layer on an operating system, like other computer programs.ex- Xen , PROXMOX

**IN 1990 NASA SAID SANSKRIT IS THE LEAST AMBIGUISE LANGUAGE FOR COMPUTERS**

20. ## HOW PROGRAM WORKS

**PROGRAM(CODE) GOES INTO COMPILER THEN IT GOES INTO ASSEMBLER THEN INTO LINKER THEN INTO LOADER THEN INTO MAIN MEMORY(RAM) THEN IT PROCESS**

**PROGRAM->COMPILER->ASSEMBLER->LINKER->LOADER->MAIN MEMORY->PROCESS**






21. **ABSTRACTION - abstraction is the process of simplifying code or a program by removing irrelevant or distracting details.** 
#### ALWAYS REMEMBER ABSTRACTION COMES WITH COST


22. # Von Neumann architecture and harvard architecture

** Von Neumann architecture - Von Neumann Architecture is a digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept of stored program computers where program data and instruction data are stored in the same memory. This architecture was designed by the famous mathematician and physicist John Von Neumann in 1945.**




** harvard architecture - Harvard Architecture is the digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept where there are separate storage and separate buses (signal path) for instruction and data. It was basically developed to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumann Architecture.**
