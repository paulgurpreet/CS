COMPUTER - Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research
AND is defined as 'A computer is an electronic device that takes in raw data from the user and processes it. It can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of logical or arithmetic operations'

COMPUTER is  mainly divided into three parts- 1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network

1. COMPUTATION:-

1.1 CPU - Central processing unit is the primary component of a computer that acts as its â€œcontrol center.

1.2 DPU - A data processing unit is  a specialized processor that helps the central processing unit (CPU) with tasks like networking, security, and storage.
    DPUs are sometimes called "IPUs" (for "infrastructure processing unit") or "SmartNICs". Leading providers of DPUs include NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD.
    
1.3 APU - Accelerated Processing Unit is a processor that combines a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) into one chip.

1.4 NPU - A neural processing unit is a specialized processor that accelerates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

1.5 TPU - Tensor Processing Unit is a custom-made application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google to speed up machine learning workloads. TPUs are designed for neural networks and are known for their high throughput and parallelism.

1.6 FPGA - A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be reconfigured after manufacturing to suit specific needs. FPGAs are often used in applications that require high data processing or transactions, such as financial trading, molecular dynamics, and bioscience.

1.7 ASIC - Application-Specific integrated circuit is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

1.8 CISC - A Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processor is a type of computer architecture that uses a large set of instructions to perform complex tasks.

1.9 RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer is a microprocessor that uses a small set of simple instructions to perform tasks.
    (ARM ARCHITECTURE)

 1.10 RISC-V  - RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that's used to design custom processors for a variety of applications. It's based on the principles of reduced instruction set computers (RISC) and is pronounced "risk-five".

2. MEMORY AND STORAGE -  the electronic components that store data and instructions for a computer to access quickly. It is used to store information that the computer's processor needs to run applications and open files.Memory is what your computer uses to store data temporarily, while storage is where you save files permanently.
               TPYES OF IT -
   2.1 PRIMARY - Also known as main memory, this is the computer's main memory that stores data, programs, and instructions that are currently in use.Like RAM
   2.2 SECONDARY - This type of memory provides permanent storage for data that doesn't erase when the computer is turned off. It's often used for backing up data, disaster recovery, and storing critical data for long periods of time.Like HARDDISK
